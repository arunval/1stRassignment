# 1st Data science project in R
This is an EDA project to explore and identify factors responsible for low customer satisfaction of UBER rides and study the 'supply-Demand ' gap.
The aim of analysis is to identify the root cause of the problem (i.e. cancellation and non-availability of cars) 
and recommend ways to improve the situation.

Data quality issues dealt with
Understood the business model of UBER
New metrics of hourly data of rides derived
Univariate analysis done and plots created
Factors for 'Demand-Supply' gap identified
